# yankeesTweets

This sample is a piece of instructional code created for a college student to help them learn Python and basic NLP skills. It walks through the process of extracting data from the Twitter API and getting basic insights on people's opinions prior to running inferential statistics.

In this specific example, tweets about the New York Yankees are extracted from Twitter, and broken down by simple regions of the country. A  sentiment analysis approach is taken to explore whether tweets are generally positive or negative, and whether this is affected by where a tweeter lives.

The code is structured to guide the student to make their own decisions about their analysis. As a result, there are several places that prompt the student to think about how they would change or improve the code for their own project.

Note: The extraction portion of the code requires API credentials that I have not included here. The raw, uncleaned, and cleaned data are provided as text files; these can be used to skip the extraction portion and jump to the cleaning/analysis portion.
